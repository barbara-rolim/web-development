  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Barbara, a passionate professional driven by technology and innovation.</p>

  <p>
    My journey began in Advertising & Marketing in Brazil, where I earned my degree and 
    developed a strong foundation in strategy and communication. In 2016, I embraced a new adventure 
    and made Porto, Portugal, my home, continuously expanding my academic and professional horizons.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recent years, I have immersed myself in the world of technology. In 2021, 
    I completed a Digital Marketing course, and in 2023, I took a deeper dive into programming, 
    starting with the C language at 42 Porto's Piscine and further specializing in 
    Fullstack Development at Mindera Code Academy. These experiences have strengthened my 
    problem-solving skills, teamwork, and ability to tackle complex challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge, grow professionally, and contribute to innovative solutions. 
    I thrive on challenges and continuous learning, always eager to bring value to a dynamic and creative team.
