    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Barbara, I’m 32 years old and I hold a degree in Advertising and Marketing from Brazil. In 2016, I embarked on a new chapter and made Porto, Portugal, my home.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve dedicated myself to continuous personal and professional growth. In 2021, I completed a Digital Marketing course, and in 2023, I immersed myself in the tech world. I began my programming journey with the C language during the Piscine at 42 Porto, and later completed a Fullstack Bootcamp at the renowned Mindera Code Academy.</p>

<p>I’m currently seeking opportunities to break into the tech industry, where I can apply my skills, grow through new challenges, and contribute to innovative teams. I’m passionate about technology, highly motivated, and always eager to learn.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who’s committed, adaptable, and ready to grow with your team — I’d love the opportunity to contribute to your success!</p>
